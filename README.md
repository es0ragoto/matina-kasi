This is a repository of song lyrics, with one .txt file per song, in a folder structure. One folder contains an artist.

# How to contribute
Contribution of lyrics not already in the repository is encouraged and can be done in the following ways (ordered by difficulty)
- Sending a high quality photo of a booklet/lyric sheet to [e-mail](es0ragoto@proton.me).
- Sending a high quality scan of a booklet/lyric sheet to [e-mail](es0ragoto@proton.me).
- Sending a `.txt` file of a complete lyric to [e-mail](es0ragoto@proton.me).
- Making a pull request to this repo with `.txt` files following the conventions below.

# Conventions for lyric files
### Lyrics
- Song lyrics included are only the original lyrics, i.e. no translations or romaji lyrics
- Furigana, if any, is not included　(e.g. `時間（とき）` would be written in the file as `時間`) 
- Any repetition instructions are not included. This means, for instance, that there are no rows of the form `※ repeat`, and the `※` instruction from corresponding rows are removed

### Formatting of text files
- First row of each .txt file must be of the form `[Artist]／[Song title]`, such as `Lumi/Ere／月夜の惨劇`
- Rows may not start or end with whitespace (in particular row breaks must not contain whitespace)
- Whitespace within a row may only be ` ` or `　`

### Folder structure
- Folder names are romanised, see directory `lyrics/`
- `.txt` file names have the japanese song title as far as possible (with possible forbidden symbols removed, and accounting for the fact that a song may have several versions)
